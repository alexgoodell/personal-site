		<p> My name is <a href="mailto:alexgoodell@gmail.com">Alex Goodell</a>. I'm a medical student at the <a href="http://jmp.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley - UCSF Joint Medical Program</a> and a researcher at the <a href="http://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/">PRL Institute for Health Policy Studies at UCSF</a>. I am interested in health and healthcare costs in developing nations, especially related to HIV/AIDS. I graduated in the spring of 2011 with a degree in biology from the <a href="http://honors.uoregon.edu/">Clark Honors College, University of Oregon</a>. </p>
		<p>I enjoy cooking with my girlfriend <a href="http://laurynporte.com">Lauryn Porte</a>, hiking, travel, sailing, and gardening. We're based in beautiful Berkeley, California.</p>

		<h2>Current projects</h2>

		<h3>Global Health Reporting Fellowship, UC Berkeley</h3>
		<h3>Global Health Decisions, UCSF</h3> 
		<p> Led by <a href="http://www.epibiostat.ucsf.edu/epidem/personnel/jkahn2.html">Professor James G Kahn </a>and colleagues, this project aims to create a web software suite to help policy makers decide between different HIV intervention portfolios. The venture is unique in that in combines an effectiveness review approach with an epidemic simulation model, producing estimates for costs, infections, prevalence, etc for a 20-year period. I serve as the web lead. More info on <a href="http://globalhealthdecisions.org">our project site</a> and we've even soft-released a <a href="http://globalhealthdecisions.com">very early test version.</a></p>
		
		<h2>Past projects</h2>
		<h3>MUHAS-UCSF Academic Learning Project</h3>
		<p>I was a research assistant for this project, led by Professors <a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/about-us/who-we-are/sarah-macfarlane">Sarah Macfarlane</a> and <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ephata_Kaaya/">Ephata Kaaya.</a> The program was a long-term partnership between the largest medical school in Tanzania (the <a href="http://www.muchs.ac.tz/">Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences</a>) and UCSF. The results of this partnership were published in a <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jphp/journal/v33/n1s/index.html">supplement</a> to The Journal of Public Health Policy. Currently, I am working on finishing a model of physician training and movement in Tanzania, called the <a href="http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/cross-campus-initiatives/muhas-ucsf-partnership/partnership-activities/modeling-human-resources-for-">Increasing Clinically Active Doctors tool</a>.</p>
		<h3>Babesia testing in the United States</h3>
		<p>Babesia microti is an emerging infection in the United States blood-banking community and is the highest infectious threat to US blood safety. I and colleagues at the <a href="http://www.bsrisf.org/">Blood Systems Research Institute</a> are studying the costs and effects of various testing strategies available to the United States</p>
		<p>I continue to be involved in a variety of small projects building simple and elegant designs for businesses and nonprofits, in addition to basic photography work. Please feel free to get in touch with me to learn more about my services.</p>
		<h3>Community Health Worker research at Village Health Works</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.villagehealthworks.org/">Village Health Works</a>, an NYC-based non-profit, operates is a small clinic in the Bururi province of Burundi. It operates a variety of novel health programs, and its founder Deogratias was recently chronicled in a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strength-What-Remains-Tracy-Kidder/dp/1400066212">Strength in What Remains by Tracy Kidder</a>. I spent six months on site in 2009 and 2010 and studied their community health worker program. My research there became my thesis, entitled <a href="GOODELL_post_defense_final.pdf">Scaling Up: Expanding Community Health Worker Programs for Former Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons in Southwest Burundi.</a></p>
		<h3>Students for Global Health</h3>
		<p>In 2007, three friends and I started <a href="http://uoglobalhealth.org">Students for Global Health </a>as a University of Oregon-based chapter of FACE AIDS.</p>
		<h3>Lane County Special Populations</h3>
		<p>From 2007-2010, I worked with the Lane County Department of Environmental Health to develope the Lane Country Special Populations Register, an online map of all facilities in Oregon that may need special assistance due to especially vulnerable populations during an evacuation. The site was later expanded into the <a href="http://www.odemsite.org/lcindex.php?view=home">Oregon Disaster Registry</a>.</p>
