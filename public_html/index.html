<h1>Alex Goodell</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm <em>Alex Goodell</em>. I'm a resident physician at <a href="http://stanfordhealthcare.org">Stanford Health Care</a>, focusing on general adult medicine and anesthesiology through Stanford's <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/anesthesia/education/residency/combined-med-anes.html#program-information">combined residency program</a>. I work at the Palo Alto Veteran's Affairs Hospital, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, Stanford University Hospital, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, and the Stanford Internal Medicine Clinic East.</p>

<p>I received my medical education at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley through the <a href="http://sph.berkeley.edu/jmp/home">UCSF-UC Berkeley Joint Medical Program</a>, a five-year MD/MS program. Previously, I studied biology at the <a href="https://honors.uoregon.edu">Clark Honors College</a> at the University of Oregon.</p>

<p>Outside of patient care, I'm interested in anesthesiology in developing countries, open-source technology, electronic medical records, and design for healthcare. I have volunteered as a researcher and photographer at <a href="http://villagehealthworks.org">Village Health Works</a>, a small community-run hospital in East Africa, based out of  Kigutu, Burundi and New York City, since 2009.</p>
