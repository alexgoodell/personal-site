# Alex Goodell 

Hi, I'm *Alex Goodell*. I'm a resident physician at [Stanford Health Care](http://stanfordhealthcare.org), focusing on general adult medicine and anesthesiology through Stanford's [combined residency program](https://med.stanford.edu/anesthesia/education/residency/combined-med-anes.html#program-information). I work at the Palo Alto Veteran's Affairs Hospital, Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, Stanford University Hospital, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, and the Stanford Internal Medicine Clinic East.

I received my medical education at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley through the [UCSF-UC Berkeley Joint Medical Program](http://sph.berkeley.edu/jmp/home), a five-year MD/MS program. Previously, I studied biology at the [Clark Honors College](https://honors.uoregon.edu) at the University of Oregon.

Outside of patient care, I'm interested in anesthesiology and critical care in developing countries, open-source technology, electronic medical records, infectious disease epidemiology, and human resources for health. I have volunteered as a researcher and photographer at [Village Health Works](http://villagehealthworks.org), a small community-run hospital in East Africa, based out of  Kigutu, Burundi and New York City, since 2009. Other projects of mine include a [medical blog](http://iatreum.com/), a [health economics tool](http://globalhealthdecisions.org) and a differential diagnosis [study tool](https://github.com/differential-med).

## For patients
If you are one of my patients at Stanford Primary Care or Stanford Internal Medicine clinics, please contact me through the [MyHealth](https://myhealth.stanfordhealthcare.org) secure messaging system or call the [Stanford Internal Medicine East](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-clinics/internal-medicine.html) clinic. If you or your loved ones are hospitalized and under my care and you wish to contact me, call the Stanford Health Care operator at 650-723-4000 and ask to page me a message. For medical emergencies, please call 911.
