<p> Hello there. My name is Alex Goodell, and I'm a global health researcher at the <a href="http://healthpolicy.ucsf.edu/">Philip R. Lee Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco</a>. I am applying to medical school and am interested in health and healthcare costs in developing nations, especially related to HIV/AIDS. I graduated in the spring of 2011 with a degree in biology from the <a href="http://honors.uoregon.edu/">Clark Honors College, University of Oregon</a>.</p>
<p>I live in the Northside neighborhood of Berkeley and enjoy cooking with my girlfreind <a href="http://laurynporte.com">Lauryn Porte</a>, hiking, travel, sailing, and gardening.</p>
